The AWS S3 (Actions) destination allows you to store event data as objects in a secure, scalable cloud storage solution. Each event is written to your S3 bucket, organized into a customizable folder structure such as by event type or timestamp. This makes it easy to manage, archive, and analyze data using downstream tools or AWS services.
